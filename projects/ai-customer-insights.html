          <h3>The Challenge</h3>
          <p>
            Teams were manually reviewing thousands of support interactions to find patterns.
            The process was slow, inconsistent, and hard to scale — and critical issues were
            often discovered late.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="projCard" style="margin-top:14px;">
          <h3>The Solution</h3>
          <p>
            Built an event-driven pipeline to ingest signals, normalize text, and generate
            structured insights. Added a RAG-based compliance layer to validate responses
            against policy docs and produce consistent outputs.

          <div class="impactTitle">⚡ The Impact</div>
          <p>
            Reduced manual analysis and made root-cause trends visible faster —
            enabling quicker decisions, better prioritization, and repeatable reporting.
